## Now we need to incorporate these fields *UnitsInStock*, *UnitsOnOrder*, *ReorderLevel*, *Discontinued* - into our calculation. We’ll define "products that need reordering" with the following:
## - *UnitsInStock* plus *UnitsOnOrder* are less than or equal to *ReorderLevel*
## - The *Discontinued* flag is false (0)
